# React in HTML

This is just a simple React webpage wrapped in HTML so that it can run in browsers.

Everything is already set up in this template, you just need to install and run `npm start`.

Compiling `.jsx` to `.js` is handled by babel.

It also has webpack configured to support hot reloading.
