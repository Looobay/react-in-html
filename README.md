# React in HTML

This is just a simple React webpage wrapped in HTML so that it can run in browsers.

Before doing anything you should install every dependancies with this command `npm install --store-dev @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server`

Everything is already set up in this template, you just need to install and run `npm start`.

Compiling `.jsx` to `.js` is handled by babel.

It also has webpack configured to support hot reloading.

After finishing cooking with web pack dont forget to do `npm run build` to apply your changes to the `index.html` file!
